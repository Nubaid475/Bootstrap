        <h1>Cricket</h1> is a bat and ball game played between two teams of <mark>eleven players</mark> ona field at the venter of which is a <pre>22 yard pitch</pre>with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on <code> three stumps</code>. The batting side scores the runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat, while the <abbr title="Bowling and Fielding">Bow and Fiel</abbr> side tries to prevent this and <blockquote>dismiss </blockquote> each batter (the player who bats) by getting them out in any of several ways. When a batter is out, they are replaced by the next batter in the batting order. The batting side continues to bat until 10 batters are out, at which point the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The team with the most runs at the end of the match wins.
